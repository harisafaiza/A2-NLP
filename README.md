LSTM + Attention Mechanism Model in Streamlit Web Application

Description

This repository contains a Streamlit web application that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Attention Mechanism to perform predictive modeling. The app utilizes these models to predict outcomes based on time-series data, showcasing the power of deep learning in handling sequential data with long-range dependencies.

The models have been implemented using PyTorch, and the app provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. It allows users to interact with the models, input data, and view predictions directly through a web browser.

Features

LSTM Model: Predicts future values in sequential data, making it ideal for time-series forecasting tasks.
Attention Mechanism: Enhances the LSTM model by allowing it to focus on important time steps, improving prediction accuracy.
Interactive Web Interface: The Streamlit app enables easy interaction by letting users input their data and receive model predictions.
Visualization: The app includes visualizations of predictions, model metrics, and loss curves to help users understand the model's performance.
Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app
You can run the application locally using Streamlit by running the following command:

streamlit run app.py

Usage

Step 1: Input your sequential data (such as time-series data) into the input fields.
Step 2: Click on the "Predict" button to generate predictions based on the input data.
Step 3: View the results displayed on the screen, including the predicted values and any additional information such as loss curves or metrics.
Models

This project includes two models:

LSTM Model: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to make predictions based on sequential data.
LSTM with Attention: An extension of the LSTM model that uses an attention mechanism to improve its performance by focusing on more important time steps in the sequence.
Both models are designed to be versatile for a variety of prediction tasks, including time-series forecasting and sequential data analysis.

Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:

torch for deep learning models (LSTM, Attention Mechanism)
streamlit for creating the web application
pandas and numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation
To install these dependencies, use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
